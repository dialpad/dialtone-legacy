Consistently using this system makes it easier for customers to scan, browse, and use Dialpad product interfaces with a predictable visual rhythm.

## Overview

Dialtone uses a spacing system based on a 4-pixel system, providing half-steps where deemed necessary. This 4px unit forms the base measurement unit for spacing in Dialtone.

<div class="d-ta-center">
  <img :src="$withBase('/assets/images/spacing-example.png')" alt="A layout example with spacing values to show how the spacing system is used." class="d-w80p" />
</div>

## CSS variables

<spacing-system-table kind="css"></spacing-system-table>

## Less variables
