## Spot illustrations

Spot illustrations are the slightly grown up version of icons with a little more detail. A spot illustration is an image that typically works in tandem with inline text to communicate a state in a more friendly way. Theyâ€™re most often used in empty states, onboarding, and in-product announcements.
