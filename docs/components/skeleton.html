title: Skeleton
description: Skeleton loader is a non-interactive placeholder that displays a preview of the UI to visually communicate that content is in the process of loading. Skeleton is used to provide a low fidelity representation of the user interface (UI) before content appears on the page.

          Use skeleton loading for dynamic content, and use actual content for static content that doesn’t change e.g. page title, headings, action components (button, toggles, checkboxes etc.).

        <li>
          Dynamic content: Content that would change after loading, usually data-based text.

        <li>
          Static content: Content that can be loaded quickly and wouldn’t change, usually non-data-based text.

          Always match the size of content that will load.

  {% header "h2", "Accessibility" %}
  {% paragraph %}
  For sighted users, they are able to see that there is loading content and no other action is needed until loading completes.
  Likewise, there is nothing that needs to be added for keyboard users. For users who rely on assistive technology, skeleton’s visual representation of a loading state won’t be accessible without additional labeling.
  {% endparagraph %}
  {% paragraph %}
  It's {% code %}role="status"{% endcode %} on the skeleton component, keep in mind, that:
  {% endparagraph %}
  {% ul %}
    <li>
      The aria live region role of status has an implicit {% code %}aria-live{% endcode %} value of {% code %}polite{% endcode %}, which allows a user to be
      notified via AT (such as a screen reader) when status messages are added. The {% code %}role{% endcode %} of {% code %}status{% endcode %} also has a default
      {% code %}aria-atomic{% endcode %} value of {% code %}true{% endcode %}, so that updates to the container marked with a role of status will result in the AT
      presenting the entire contents of the container to the user, including any author-defined labels (or additional nested elements).
    </li>
    <li>
      {% code %}aria-busy{% endcode %} state indicates an element is being modified and that assistive technologies may want to wait until the
      changes are complete before informing the user about the update. When multiple parts of a live region need to be
      loaded before changes are announced to the user, set {% code %}aria-busy="true"{% endcode %} until loading is complete.
      Then set to {% code %}aria-busy="false"{% endcode %}. This prevents assistive technologies from announcing changes before updates are done.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you need fully accessible skeleton and loading content, probably you will want to add {% code %}aria-live="polite"{% endcode %}
      and {% code %}aria-busy="false"{% endcode %} to corresponding loaded html element content.
    </li>
  {% endul %}
