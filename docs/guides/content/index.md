## Principles

When writing for the Dialpad interface, we aim to be clear, concise, helpful, and friendly.

### Clear

* Avoid jargon. Use simple words.
* Use active voice.
* Don’t beat around the bush—be straightforward and honest.

### Concise

* Make sure every sentence and word serves a purpose.
* Edit ruthlessly.
* Break up content appropriately. Avoid information overload.

### Helpful

* Anticipate user needs and meet them with content.
* Ask: what questions would users have? What uncertainty they might feel? What details would be useful for them to know?
* Give the right content to the right user at the right time. Be mindful of context and where the user is in their journey.

### Friendly

* Write like a human.
* Always write in Dialpad’s voice.
* Adjust your tone to the user’s situation.

## Voice and Tone

Voice and tone are what make our writing personable. Word choice, phrasing, and even punctuation can all impact how we sound to users.

### Voice

Our voice is consistent. It’s what makes Dialpad feel like Dialpad. It adds warmth and personality to an interface. For many of our customers, this is how they’ll communicate with our brand.

#### We are always

* ***Helpful**
  * We make it easy for users to know the information they want and need. We write with simplicity, clarity, and purpose to make it easy for everyone to follow along.
  * We aren't confusing or complicated.
* **Real**
  * We keep things straightforward and offer solutions that work for real people in real situations. We’re honest and direct, and we never overpromise.
  * We aren't misleading or vague.
* **Friendly**
  * We welcome everyone everywhere—and it shows with our words. We bring forth a warmth and approachability that will resonate with every user.
  * We aren't academic or sarcastic.
* **Bold**
  * We aren’t afraid to stand for what’s right. We take pride in our work and we feel confident that we can help our customer succeed.
  * We aren't hesitant or arrogant.

#### Active vs Passive

We use **active voice** most often. Passive voice may occasionally be appropriate, like for certain success messages or error messages where we don’t want to blame the user.

<dialtone-usage>
<template #do>

* The host canceled this meeting.
</template>
<template #dont>

* This meeting was canceled by the host.
</template>
</dialtone-usage>

### Tone

Our tone changes, and it’s what makes us sound human. We adjust our tone to meet customers where they are. We write differently when we anticipate a user feeling happy, stressed, or neutral.

#### Tones we frequently use

* **Neutral**
  * We leave no room for doubt or emotion when communicating functional or technical information.
  * Use for: education, signage, in-product guidance
* **Conversational**
  * This is our tonal baseline. We bring a warmth to our messaging when we explain or guide.
  * Use for: content marketing, our website, videos
* **Bold**
  * We bring out our personality in strategic moments that drive our brand and business forward.
  * Use for: social media, internal communications, advertising, brand experiences

## Accessibility

Good content is accessible to all kinds of people. Here are a few things to keep in mind when writing.

### Write clearly

* Use plain language
* Avoid jargon
* Aim for an 8th grade reading level or lower
* Make sure CTAs are clear about what will happen next
* Use words consistently. One word should mean the same thing across the entire interface.

### Don’t rely on visual communication alone

* Avoid directional language (e.g. “fill out the form to the left” and “click the button below”)
* Avoid communicating only with color.
* Make sure all elements have the correct aria labels.
* Make sure alt-text is appropriately documented.
* Label things clearly. Don’t rely on icons alone to convey meaning.

### Organize content for scannability

* Put the most important information first
* Use clear headers and subheaders
* Break up content into easy-to-digest chunks instead of long walls of text

## Translation

Keeping text short, clear, and straightforward makes it easier for our translators to get the right message across.

* Use active voice
* Use short, clear sentences.
* Be mindful of character limits. Because English uses less characters than several languages we translate into, try to allow for extra characters in text areas. Concise writing creates flexibility for more character-dense languages.
* Avoid culture-specific metaphors and expressions.

## Email

Good emails are helpful, concise, and actionable.

* Context is everything: make sure emails are reaching customers at a time that makes sense in their journey.
* Try to include a CTA that’s relevant to the email’s contents and helpful to the customer.
* Emails should be purposeful—don’t send too many. Our customers have granted us access to their inbox, and we don’t want to abuse it.
* Make subject lines relevant to the email’s contents. Don’t use emoji.
* Even though there’s more space to write in an email than in the UI, keep things concise and readable. Don’t over-explain or add a lot of fluff.

## Word list

It’s important to use the same words and spellings across the interface. This limits confusion and helps our customers (and internal employees) communicate more clearly.

## Abbreviations and acronyms

Generally, we <strong>avoid abbreviations and acronyms unless they’re commonly used</strong>. Oftentimes they’re jargon or require specific domain knowledge to understand.

Because contact center users are more specialized than talk users, it may occasionally be clearer to use a common acronym or abbreviation.

<dialtone-usage>
<template #do>

* Unmute microphone
</template>
<template #dont>

* Unmute mic
</template>
</dialtone-usage>

<!-- This should be a JSON file, spit out as a styled <dl> -->

<table class="d-table dialtone-doc-table d-body-base">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="d-w25p" scope="col">
        Abbreviation
      </th>
      <th scope="col">
        Description

  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">KB</th>
      <td>Kilobytes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Capitalization

We use <strong>sentence case</strong> for all of our writing, with the exception of eyebrow headers (which are in all caps).

* Only capitalize the first word of every phrase.
* Proper nouns like names, branded product features, and places are still capitalized like normal.

<dialtone-usage>
<template #do>

* Search contacts and messages
* ![Correct: Eyebrow text styled as uppercase](/assets/images/eyebrow--do.png)

</template>
<template #dont>

* Search Contacts and Messages
* ![Incorrect: Eyebrow text styled as lowcase](/assets/images/eyebrow--dont.png)

</template>
</dialtone-usage>

## Contractions

We use contractions often. They help us sound human and friendly.

* Stick to commonly used contractions
* Avoid any that sound unusual or regional

<dialtone-usage>
<template #do>

* You’ll
* You’re
* They’re
* Don’t
* Aren’t
* Won’t
* Isn’t
* Haven’t

</template>
<template #dont>

* Ain’t
* Would’ve
* Y’all
* There’re
* Needn’t
* You’d’ve
* You’d
* Mustn’t

</template>
</dialtone-usage>

## Currency

* Don’t include the cents digits (“.00”) for a whole dollar amount.
* Always put the dollar sign before the amount for USD and CAD.
* Only include the currency if it’s needed for clarity. Currency always follows the amount.

<dialtone-usage>
<template #do>

* $25 USD
* $47.95 CAD

</template>
<template #dont>

* $25.00 USD
* CAD 47.95$

</template>
</dialtone-usage>

## Dates

Depending on context, dates may need to be displayed to varying levels of specificity.

When deciding which format to use, consider how much information users need in the context of their journey.

When written out, dates are represented in this order **[Day of week], [Month] [Date], [Year]**.

* Don’t use ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.)
* Use commas to separate the day of the week, month and numerical day, and year.
* Include all 4 digits for the year

### Formats by length

<table class="d-table dialtone-doc-table d-body-base">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="d-w25p" scope="col">
        Format
      </th>
      <th scope="col">
        Example
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Long date</th>
      <td>Thursday, September 2, 2022</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Medium date</th>
      <td>September 2, 2022</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Short date</th>
      <td>Thu, Sep 2, 2022<br>Sep 2, 2022</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">If you need to leave out the year</th>
      <td>September 2<br>Sep 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Abbreviating dates

If space isn’t an issue, spell out the full day of the week and month. When space is constrained, abbreviate days of the week and months.

<table class="d-table dialtone-doc-table d-body-base">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="d-w25p" scope="col">
        Format
      </th>
      <th scope="col">
        Example
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Days of the week</th>
      <td>
        <ul class="d-ls-reset">
          <li>Monday - Mon</li>
          <li>Tuesday - Tue</li>
          <li>Wednesday - Wed</li>
          <li>Thursday - Thu</li>
          <li>Friday - Fri</li>
          <li>Saturday - Sat</li>
          <li>Sunday - Sun</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Months</th>
      <td>
        <ul class="d-ls-reset">
          <li>January - Jan</li>
          <li>February - Feb</li>
          <li>March - Mar</li>
          <li>April - Apr</li>
          <li>May</li>
          <li>June - Jun</li>
          <li>July - Jul</li>
          <li>August - Aug</li>
          <li>September - Sep</li>
          <li>October - Oct</li>
          <li>November - Nov</li>
          <li>December - Dec</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Date and time

To represent a date and time, use **[Day of week], [Month] [Date], [Year] at HH:MM:SS AM/PM**:

<dl class="dialtone-definition">
  <dt>Examples</dt>
  <dd>Thursday, September 2, 2022 at 12:45 PM</dd>
  <dd>September 2 at 12:45 PM</dd>
  <dd>Sep 2 at 12:45 PM</dd>
</dl>

### Numerical Dates

Avoid writing dates numerically to avoid confusion. Different countries use different formats for this scenario, and we don’t yet localize dates and times.

For cases when dates are represented in a table or in extremely compact UIs, use **MM/DD/YY**.

<dl class="dialtone-definition">
  <dt>Examples</dt>
  <dd>09/02/22</dd>
</dl>

### Usage Examples

<dialtone-usage>
<template #do>

* November 2
* November 2, 2022
* 11/02/22

</template>
<template #dont>

* November 2nd
* November 2 2022
* 11022022

</template>
</dialtone-usage>

## Localization

Currently we use standardized American English spellings.

## Phone numbers

* For North American phone numbers, write the area code in parentheses and use a hyphen between the first 3 and last 4 digits.
* Don’t add a space between the area code and main phone number. Don’t add country codes for local numbers.
* When a customer views a number from a different country, add a plus sign and the country code.
* Do not add a space between the country code and area code.

<dialtone-usage>
<template #do>

* (423) 665-2345
* +45 (423) 665-2345

</template>
<template #dont>

* 423-665-2345
* +45-423-665-2345

</template>
</dialtone-usage>

## Time

Depending on context, dates may need to be displayed to varying levels of specificity.
Times are represented as **HH:MM:SS AM/PM**.

* We use a 12-hour clock.
* Always use a space before AM and PM.
* Include seconds only when appropriate and useful to customers

<dialtone-usage>
<template #do>

* 12:45 AM
* 12:45:30 PM

</template>
<template #dont>

* 12:45AM
* 12:45:30PM
* 12:45 am
* 12:45:30 pm

</template>
</dialtone-usage>

### Time ranges

Use an en dash (–, `&ndash;`) with no surrounding spaces.

* Always include AM or PM for the second time.
* Only include AM or PM for the first time if it’s different from the second one:

<dialtone-usage>
<template #do>

* 5:00–6:00 PM
* 11:30 AM–4:00 PM

</template>
<template #dont>

* 5:00 pm–6:00 PM

</template>
</dialtone-usage>

### Time zones

* Don’t include an S (for Standard) or D (for Daylight)
* Do include a space between AM/PM and the time zone

<dialtone-usage>
<template #do>

* 3:00 PM PT

</template>
<template #dont>

* 3:00 PM PST

</template>
</dialtone-usage>

### Relative Timestamps

Relative timestamps may change based on context. When using relative timestamps, aim to include the definite time as additional information, like in a tool tip.

* Spell out **minutes**, **seconds**, and **hours** whenever possible
* If necessary, abbreviate:
  * hours - hr
  * minutes - min
  * seconds - s
