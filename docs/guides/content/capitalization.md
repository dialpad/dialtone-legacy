title: Capitalization
desc: We use <strong>sentence case</strong> for all of our writing, with the exception of eyebrow headers (which are in all caps).
---

- Only capitalize the first word of every phrase.
- Proper nouns like names, branded product features, and places are still capitalized like normal.
