title: Writing for translation
desc: Keeping text short, clear, and straightforward makes it easier for our translators to get the right message across.

- Use active voice
- Use short, clear sentences.
- Be mindful of character limits. Because English uses less characters than several languages we translate into, try to allow for extra characters in text areas. Concise writing creates flexibility for more character-dense languages.
- Avoid culture-specific metaphors and expressions.
