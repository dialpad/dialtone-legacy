title: Writing for email
desc: Good emails are helpful, concise, and actionable.
---

- Context is everything: make sure emails are reaching customers at a time that makes sense in their journey.
- Try to include a CTA that’s relevant to the email’s contents and helpful to the customer.
- Emails should be purposeful—don’t send too many. Our customers have granted us access to their inbox, and we don’t want to abuse it.
- Make subject lines relevant to the email’s contents. Don’t use emoji.
- Even though there’s more space to write in an email than in the UI, keep things concise and readable. Don’t over-explain or add a lot of fluff.
