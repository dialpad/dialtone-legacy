## Write clearly

- Use plain language
- Avoid jargon
- Aim for an 8th grade reading level or lower
- Make sure CTAs are clear about what will happen next
- Use words consistently. One word should mean the same thing across the entire interface.

## Don’t rely on visual communication alone

- Avoid directional language (e.g. “fill out the form to the left” and “click the button below”)
- Avoid communicating only with color.
- Make sure all elements have the correct aria labels.
- Make sure alt-text is appropriately documented.
- Label things clearly. Don’t rely on icons alone to convey meaning.

## Organize content for scannability

- Put the most important information first
- Use clear headers and subheaders
- Break up content into easy-to-digest chunks instead of long walls of text
