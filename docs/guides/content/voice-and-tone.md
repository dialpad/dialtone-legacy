title: Voice and Tone
desc: Voice and tone are what make our writing personable. Word choice, phrasing, and even punctuation can all impact how we sound to users.

## Voice

Our voice is consistent. It’s what makes Dialpad feel like Dialpad. It adds warmth and personality to an interface. For many of our customers, this is how they’ll communicate with our brand.

### We are always

- **Helpful**
  - We make it easy for users to know the information they want and need. We write with simplicity, clarity, and purpose to make it easy for everyone to follow along.
  - We aren't confusing or complicated.
- **Real**
  - We keep things straightforward and offer solutions that work for real people in real situations. We’re honest and direct, and we never overpromise.
  - We aren't misleading or vague.
- **Friendly**
  - We welcome everyone everywhere—and it shows with our words. We bring forth a warmth and approachability that will resonate with every user.
  - We aren't academic or sarcastic.
- **Bold**
  - We aren’t afraid to stand for what’s right. We take pride in our work and we feel confident that we can help our customer succeed.
  - We aren't hesitant or arrogant.

### Active vs Passive

We use **active voice** most often. Passive voice may occasionally be appropriate, like for certain success messages or error messages where we don’t want to blame the user.

## Tone

Our tone changes, and it’s what makes us sound human. We adjust our tone to meet customers where they are. We write differently when we anticipate a user feeling happy, stressed, or neutral.

### Tones we frequently use

- **Neutral**
  - We leave no room for doubt or emotion when communicating functional or technical information.
  - Use for: education, signage, in-product guidance
- **Conversational**
  - This is our tonal baseline. We bring a warmth to our messaging when we explain or guide.
  - Use for: content marketing, our website, videos
- **Bold**
  - We bring out our personality in strategic moments that drive our brand and business forward.
  - Use for: social media, internal communications, advertising, brand experiences
