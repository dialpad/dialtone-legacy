## Clear

* Avoid jargon. Use simple words.
* Use active voice.
* Don’t beat around the bush—be straightforward and honest.

## Concise

* Make sure every sentence and word serves a purpose.
* Edit ruthlessly.
* Break up content appropriately. Avoid information overload.

## Helpful

* Anticipate user needs and meet them with content.
* Ask: what questions would users have? What uncertainty they might feel? What details would be useful for them to know?
* Give the right content to the right user at the right time. Be mindful of context and where the user is in their journey.

## Friendly

* Write like a human.
* Always write in Dialpad’s voice.
* Adjust your tone to the user’s situation.
