## Components

Components are reusable building blocks that support a specific interaction or UI need. These components can be reused across Dialpad products and projects
ensuring UI consistency and cohesion while helping teams deliver high-quality features faster.

Dialtone provides two options to use the components: CSS and Vue.

### Vue components (recommended)

Use [Vue components](https://vue.dialpad.design/) in the case your project supports Vue since these components are built conforming to [WCAG AA Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/)
and with usability and performance in mind.

### CSS components

If Vue isn't supported in your application, you can use the [CSS components](../components/avatar.md) in your project, but you'll be responsible
for writing the correct markup, managing DOM elements and events, and making it [accessible for all users](../getting-started/accessibility/fundamentals.md).

See more about [components usage](../getting-started/usage.md/#components).

### Previous Version

[Dialtone 6](https://dialpad.design/version6/) remains viewable, though is no longer being maintained. [Reach out](#contact-us) to the Dialtone team if you have any questions.

## Intake
