Hey everyone, I'd like communicate some recent updates to Dialtone's infrastructure.
There is one small breaking change that consumers of Dialtone Vue will need to make after this update.

The Dialtone developers will make this update in Dialpad, but if you maintain an app separate from Dialpad you'll have to make this update yourself.

## Breaking change

Dialtone Vue's CSS file is now bundled into Dialtone's CSS file, so you no longer need to import Dialtone Vue's CSS file into your code, please remove any of the following lines:

```js
import '@dialpad/dialtone-vue/css';
```

or within another css file:

```css
@import 'node_modules/@dialpad/dialtone-vue/dist/style.css';
```

<script setup>
import BlogPost from '@baseComponents/BlogPost.vue';
import { parse } from 'date-fns';
</script>
