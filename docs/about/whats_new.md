<BlogPost author="Brad Paugh" :date="new Date(2022, 10, 7)" heading="Release of our new blog">

Welcome to the first post of our "What's New?" blogging section. Here you can find detailed info about updates we have recently released, such as:

- Info on breaking changes and potential migration guides
- New components
- Updates to existing components
- Bug fixes
- Updates to the documentation site
- Changes to existing process related to Dialtone
- Reminders on process and best practices

We will continue to update this blog with fancy new features and visual updates. So what's new with Dialtone other than this page?

### Icons

We just released an entirely new set of icons. This comes along with a new [Dialtone Icon Component](http://dialpad.design/components/icon.html) and [Dialtone Vue Icon Component](https://vue.dialpad.design/?path=/story/components-icon--default) to make using Dialtone icons easier than ever! Full documentation of all icons is still on the way, but you can see the most frequently used icons on the [Dialtone page](http://dialpad.design/components/icon.html), and you can see the list of all available icons in the [Vue Component](https://vue.dialpad.design/?path=/story/components-icon--default). There will be a migration guide coming shortly to migrate all existing icons in the product to the new ones. At the moment the old icons are still published and exist as they always have. To use the new icons please use the new [Dialtone Vue Icon Component](https://vue.dialpad.design/?path=/story/components-icon--default).

### Component Overview Page

Dialtone has been missing a component overview landing page for quite some time. I'm happy to say it's finally been released and you can check it out here:
