# Dialtone

foo bar

This is the home for Dialtone, Dialpad's design system. It includes the resources needed to create consistent, predictable interfaces that conform to Dialpad’s design principles, language, styles, and best practices.

## Install Dialtone via NPM

To add Dialtone into your project, you can install it via NPM:

```
npm install --save-dev @dialpad/dialtone
```

Once installed, add the following line in your Less file:
```
@import "your/path/to/dialtone.less";
```
If you only need access to Dialtone's variables and customizations to build a file and don't need the whole library exported, use this line instead in your Less file:
```
@import (reference) "your/path/to/dialtone.less";
```
