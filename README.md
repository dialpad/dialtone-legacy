# Dialtone

This is the home for Dialtone, Dialpad's design system. It includes the resources needed to create consistent, predictable interfaces that conform to Dialpadâ€™s design principles, language, styles, and best practices.

## Install Dialtone

### Install it via NPM:
```
npm install @dialpad/dialtone
```

### Import dialtone:
- CSS/LESS:
```less
@import "node_modules/@dialpad/dialtone/lib/dist/css/dialtone.min.css";
```
- Javascript:
```js
import '@dialpad/dialtone/lib/dist/css/dialtone.min.css';
```

### Add dialtone's theme class to the `<body>`

- Light mode
```html
<body class="dialtone-theme-light">...</body>
```

- Dark mode
```html
<body class="dialtone-theme-dark">...</body>
```

This will define the Dialtone CSS variables for your desired theme. 
It is required to do this for Dialtone to function.
