# Dialtone

This is the home for Dialtone, Dialpad's design system. It includes the resources needed to create consistent, predictable interfaces that conform to Dialpadâ€™s design principles, language, styles, and best practices.

## Install Dialtone via NPM

To add Dialtone into your project, you can install it via NPM:

```
npm install @dialpad/dialtone
```

Once installed, add the following line in your CSS/LESS file:
```
@import "node_modules/@dialpad/dialtone/lib/dist/css/dialtone.css";
```

And dialtone's theme class to the `<body>`

**Light mode**
```html
<body class="dialtone-theme-light">...</body>
```

**Dark mode**
```html
<body class="dialtone-theme-dark">...</body>
```

It is important to add either of those classes in order to make dialtone work, as CSS variables
definition change according to the selected mode (light, dark). 

If the class is not added, the CSS variables aren't going to be defined.
