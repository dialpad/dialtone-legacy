# Dialtone

This is the home for Dialtone, Dialpad's design system. It includes the resources needed to create consistent, predictable interfaces that conform to Dialpadâ€™s design principles, language, styles, and best practices.

## Install Dialtone via NPM

To add Dialtone into your project, you can install it via NPM:

```
npm install --save-dev @dialpad/dialtone
```

Once installed, add the following line in your Less file:
```
@import "your/path/to/dialtone.less";
```
If you only need access to Dialtone's variables and customizations to build a file and don't need the whole library exported, use this line instead in your Less file:
```
@import (reference) "your/path/to/dialtone.less";
```
