# Releasing

## Requirements to run `semantic-release`, which is used in this guide https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/#requirements

`semantic-release` uses the commit messages to determine the consumer impact of changes in the codebase. In Dialtone we use [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) for commit messages, so semantic-release automatically determines the next semantic version number, generates a changelog and publishes the release.

| Commit Type                 | Release type  |
|-----------------------------|:-------------:|
| Commit with breaking change | Major release |
| Commit with type feat       | Minor release |
| Commit with type fix        | Patch release |
| Commit with type perf       | Patch release |

## Steps

In order to push the `production` branch to deploy the documentation site and/or trigger a release to [npmjs](https://npmjs.com) and Github Releases, you will need to either be an admin of the Dialtone repository, be a user with the "Maintain" role or have manually been given permission on your user.

### Production release:

1. Make sure your `staging` and `production` branches are up-to-date locally.
2. Checkout to `staging` branch.
3. Stop your local server and keep your working directory clean before versioning.
4. In your CLI window, run `npm run release` from the Dialtone repository directory.
5. If there are changes that should trigger a release:
   - The script will update the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files with the version number according to the types of changes introduced since the last release and will add release notes in the `CHANGELOG.MD` file. 
   - A release commit and a git tag associated with this commit will be created and pushed to the remote.
6. If there are no relevant changes to trigger a release, you can still deploy changes to the documentation site.
7. We are ready to deploy the release. Switch to the `production` branch: `git checkout production`.
8. Merge the release commits from `staging` using [`fast-forward` strategy](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#Documentation/git-merge.txt---ff-only): `git merge staging --ff-only`.
9. If the commits merged correctly, we can now push to the remote: `git push`.
10. If there were changes to the library, GitHub Actions will now deploy a new release of Dialtone to npm.
11. Github Actions will now deploy the documentation site to our GitHub Pages site: [dialpad.design](https://dialpad.design).
12. You should be able to see your deployment running at [Dialtone Github actions](https://github.com/dialpad/dialtone/actions).
13. When the Github Actions have been completed, the new version of the package should have been deployed to Github releases, npm, and the documentation website (`dialpad.design`) is now updated (if it was a production release).
14. Now youâ€™re ready to update your projects to use the latest Dialtone version ðŸŽ‰.

### Pre-release (`alpha` or `beta`):

1. Merge your feature branch to `beta` or `alpha`.
2. Checkout to `beta` or `alpha` branch.
3. Stop your local server and keep your working directory clean before versioning.
4. In your CLI window, run `npm run release` from the Dialtone repository directory.
5. If there are changes that should trigger a release:
   - The script will update the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files with the version number according to the types of changes introduced since the last release and will add release notes in the `CHANGELOG.MD` file. 
   - A release commit and a git tag associated with this commit will be created and pushed to the remote.
6. If there are no relevant changes to trigger a release, you can still deploy changes to the documentation site.
7. Since your pre-release branch was pushed to the remote, the deploy Github Action should have been triggered.
8. Merge the release you have made on `beta` or `alpha` branch into your feature branch so you have the release commit in sync:
   - Replace `$FEATURE_BRANCH` with your feature branch name and `$RELEASED_BRANCH` with the branch name you have released `beta` or `alpha`:
      ```
      git checkout $FEATURE_BRANCH
      git merge --ff-only $RELEASED_BRANCH
      ```
9. Push to the remote: `git push`.
10. You should be able to see your deployment running at [Dialtone Github actions](https://github.com/dialpad/dialtone/actions).
11. When the Github Actions have been completed, the new version of the package should have been deployed to Github releases, npm.
12. Now youâ€™re ready to update your projects to use the recently deployed Dialtone version ðŸŽ‰.
